// ProcessFootprint is a read-only measurement of the live processes one
// ownership handle covers. It carries counts and bytes only: never a command
// line, an environment value, a credential, or a resume token, so it is safe to
// project on a diagnostic surface.
//
// The walk is identity-bearing. It starts from the process identifier this
// manager owns and follows parent links, so every measured process is a
// descendant of this instance's own agent process rather than a host-wide
// process-name match.
//
// The byte totals cover only processes the walk could actually measure.
// UnreadableProcesses counts owned processes whose measurement failed, and the
// byte totals are then a lower bound; a caller must never read a nonzero
// UnreadableProcesses as zero memory. A platform that cannot report commit
// charge per process leaves CommittedBytes at zero rather than estimating it
// from resident bytes.
