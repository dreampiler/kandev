// after a timeout, repeatedly, for as long as the record is retained.
//
// The row is looked up by the calling session's own (sender_task_id,
// sender_session_id) pair, so another session's identity is reported as not
// claimed and its existence never leaks. The answer is one of:
//
//   - state "pending": the first attempt may still commit. Wait and re-read; do
//     not resend.
//   - state "committed": it was delivered. Do not resend; the receipt names the
//     artifact.
//   - state "failed": it was definitively refused. retry_safe is true and a
//     fresh identity may send the same content again.
//   - claimed=false: no such send was ever claimed under this identity, which
//     is a conclusive negative rather than an absence of evidence.
