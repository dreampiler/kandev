# Archived Data Retention Requirements

## Overview

Administrators can reduce installed storage by shrinking data that belongs to
finished work: the tool progress detail inside transcripts of archived tasks, and
the operational snapshot stored on completed resource-cleanup jobs. System-page
owns this maintenance policy and its Data & Logs settings surface.

This policy governs two targets with independent windows. It does not replace the
existing tool-payload policy, which remains the inactivity-based policy over
active-task conversation history and keeps its own setting, revision, and approved
state. See [Tool Payload Retention](tool-payload-retention.md).

Both targets ship **disabled**. Cleanup remains disabled until an administrator
completes the preparation choice.

## Terminology

- **Archived task:** A task whose `archived_at` is set at or before the archived
  cutoff. A task unarchived before a batch commits is not an archived task.
- **Completed cleanup job:** A `task_resource_cleanup_jobs` row whose state is
  `succeeded` and whose `completed_at` is at or before the cleanup cutoff. Every
  other state, including a missing or unreadable completion timestamp, is
  retained.
- **Archive source evidence contract:** The three snapshot fields
  `archive_source_manifest`, `workspace_id`, and `worktrees`. Together they are
  what the archive-source-manifest read endpoint still consumes from a completed
  job.
- **Stored-byte reduction:** The reduction in stored column bytes. This is
  different from a reduction in the database file size.

## Requirements

### REQ-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-001: Policy and analysis

**Intent:** Let administrators understand both targets before data is removed.

**User story:** As an administrator, I want a savings estimate for archived
transcripts and completed cleanup jobs, so that I can compare the storage effect
with the history I give up.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-001.1:** The Data & Logs page at
  `/settings/system/data-storage` shall expose an independent archived-data
  policy, disabled by default, including on upgrades.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-001.2:** Administrators shall select a
  whole-day window for each target independently. The initial values are 30 days
  of archived history and 7 days of finished cleanup. Valid values are 1-3650
  days. Invalid input shall save nothing.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-001.3:** Eligibility shall use the
  archived timestamp for transcripts and the completion timestamp for cleanup
  jobs. A row exactly at the cutoff remains protected.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-001.4:** An administrator shall be able
  to analyze an unsaved policy while cleanup remains disabled. Opening the page
  shall not start an analysis, backup, or cleanup.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-001.5:** Analysis shall report each
  target separately: rows scanned, rows eligible, rows reduced, stored bytes
  before the pass, bytes removed, oversize rows, and skipped-data counts. A
  partial or failed analysis shall never appear as a complete estimate. Policy
  edits shall mark previous results as stale.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-001.6:** The page shall state that the
  result is a stored-byte reduction and not a file-size reduction, and shall
  point at the separate compaction action.

### REQ-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-002: Archived transcript detail

**Intent:** Reclaim archived conversation volume without damaging history.

**User story:** As an administrator, I want tool progress detail removed from
long-archived transcripts, so that old conversations stop dominating storage while
the conversation itself stays readable.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-002.1:** Cleanup shall use the existing
  removal rules and the existing removal marker. It shall not introduce a second
  marker vocabulary or a divergent remover for the same field.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-002.2:** Cleanup shall preserve message
  rows, content, identity, ordering, type, and timestamps. Only `metadata` shall
  shrink.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-002.3:** A task unarchived between
  selection and commit shall not be modified. A task inside the window shall not
  be selected.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-002.4:** Because the archived target is
  a safety net for tasks the inactivity policy declines, a nonterminal session, a
  pending question, or a queued workflow admission on an archived task shall not
  by itself block this target. The archived timestamp is its only gate, and the
  existing inactivity policy keeps its own protections unchanged.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-002.5:** Removed details shall not
  reappear after delayed updates, replay, or task resumption. Conversations shall
  show an explicit removed-payload state.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-002.6:** A row already carrying the
  removal marker shall be left intact and counted as already removed, so a second
  trigger is a no-op rather than a second removal.

### REQ-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-003: Completed cleanup-job snapshots

**Intent:** Reclaim finished-job operational material while keeping the archive
source evidence readable.

**User story:** As an administrator, I want the operational snapshot of a
finished cleanup job reduced, so that completed jobs stop consuming storage while
archive evidence stays retrievable after task deletion.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-003.1:** Only a `succeeded` job with a
  readable completion timestamp at or before the cutoff shall be reduced. The
  `pending`, `retry_wait`, `waiting_for_clean`, `running`, `prepared`, `failed`,
  and `cancelled` states shall never be reduced.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-003.2:** The archive source evidence
  contract shall survive reduction. `archive_source_manifest`, `workspace_id`, and
  `worktrees` shall be preserved byte-for-byte, because the manifest read path
  authorizes `workspace_id` and matches each manifest against `worktrees`.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-003.3:** Reducing a generation that
  carries a manifest shall return the same manifests, apply the same workspace
  authorization, and reject a foreign workspace exactly as before reduction,
  including after the task row has been deleted.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-003.4:** A snapshot shall record a
  reduction marker carrying the marker version, the reduction time, the removed
  field paths, and the net byte reduction. An unknown top-level key shall be
  dropped deliberately, because the retained set is the evidence contract rather
  than an inventory of known field names.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-003.5:** A malformed snapshot shall be
  skipped and counted, never deleted.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-003.6:** The job row, its trigger, its
  state, attempt count, `next_attempt_at`, `last_error`, `created_at`,
  `updated_at`, and `completed_at` shall remain, so cleanup history and its result
  summary stay available.

### REQ-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-004: Backup, scheduling, and access

**Intent:** Keep removal deliberate, bounded, and reversible at the database level.

**User story:** As an administrator, I want a backup choice and a bounded daily
pass, so that the policy cannot quietly consume the database or the writer.

#### Acceptance criteria

- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-004.1:** The preparation, approved
  revision gate, bounded batches, and daily schedule shall follow the existing
  tool-payload governance frame. Enabling this policy shall not read, write, or
  change the `tool_payload_retention` record, its revision, or its approved state.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-004.2:** Before the first mutation the
  administrator shall explicitly choose backup or continue without backup. No
  choice shall be inferred from silence. A pending choice arms no deletion.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-004.3:** If backup is selected, cleanup
  shall wait for a completed, verified backup. Failure, cancellation, or an
  interrupted preparation shall block cleanup.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-004.4:** Each batch shall be bounded by
  row count and byte budget, and a single row above the oversize ceiling shall be
  skipped intact. A pass shall recheck eligibility inside the writer transaction
  and end the pass when the database schema changed under it.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-004.5:** No batch shall run while
  backup, restore, reset, or compaction owns the shared maintenance admission.
  Reset and restore shall stop this worker before they proceed.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-004.6:** An unreadable policy or
  preparation state shall block deletion rather than proceeding.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-004.7:** An enabled policy shall check
  daily for eligible data, and administrators shall also be able to request a pass
  now under the saved, enabled policy. Only one archived-data operation shall
  execute at a time, and it shall be cancellable at a batch boundary.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-004.8:** Only SQLite is supported. Other
  engines shall show an unavailable state and reject analysis and mutation
  requests without side effects.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-004.9:** Read-only users shall see
  status but cannot analyze, change the policy, or start a pass. All copy shall be
  localized, and phone users shall have the same actions with 44px touch targets,
  one page scroll owner, and no horizontal overflow.
- **AC-SYSTEM-PAGE-ARCHIVED-DATA-RETENTION-004.10:** No pass shall compact, vacuum,
  truncate, or discard a manual backup. Compaction stays the separate explicit
  operator action.

## Out of scope

- Message deletion, database compaction, index removal, and file-size reduction.
- Any change to the existing inactivity-based tool-payload policy, or to Office
  run-history and filesystem retention.
- Fixing the source duplication of the large per-session metadata blobs inside a
  cleanup-job snapshot; this policy reduces the copy, it does not stop its growth.
- Retention for worktrees, task environments, or provider-side history.
