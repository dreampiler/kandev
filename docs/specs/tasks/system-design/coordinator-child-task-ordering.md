# Coordinator Child Task Ordering System Design

## Purpose and boundaries

The MCP adapter changes the same `tasks.position` used by board drag ordering
and WIP admission. It delegates persistence and publication to the existing
`task/service.ReorderStepTasks` contract. Global ceiling replay follows the
[agents design](../../agents/system-design/session-concurrency-ceiling.md).

## Requirement mapping

| Requirement | Design section |
| --- | --- |
| `REQ-TASKS-COORDINATOR-CHILD-TASK-ORDERING-001` | [Control flow](#control-flow), [Authorization and failure](#authorization-and-failure) |

## Data and contracts

`reorder_child_tasks_kandev` accepts an array of child IDs and
`placement: in_place | front`. `internal/mcp/server` registers it only in the
Kanban task profile, outside the shared automation catalog. Its handler builds
a fresh `mcp.reorder_child_tasks` payload and injects `sender_task_id` from the
server's calling task. The public schema does not expose sender attribution.

The response contains `workflow_step_id`, `band`, `placement`, `revision`,
and `tasks` entries with `id`, `title`, and `position` in the new band order.

## Control flow

1. The backend resolves the sender and named children and validates their
   workspace, direct-parent relationship, workflow step, and band.
2. It reads the workflow's tasks and selects the target step's band. The queued
   predicate is `!wip_admitted && queued_for_step_id == stepID`; all other tasks
   in the step are admitted. `models.StepOrderLess` establishes current order.
3. `in_place` replaces only named slots. `front` prepends named IDs and appends
   remaining IDs in their existing relative order.
4. The adapter submits the complete band to `ReorderStepTasks`. The repository
   validates membership and commits positions and revision transactionally.
5. The service publishes `task.reordered`; existing board consumers and queued
   admission use those positions without a separate frontend or queue model.

## Authorization and failure

Task-service reads retain their normal workspace visibility checks. The
existing reorder service retains `ScopeTaskWrite` authorization. The MCP
adapter additionally requires same-workspace direct-parent access and checks
that relationship again in the band snapshot before submitting an order.
The automation dispatcher rejects this action as outside its catalog.

On `ErrStepChanged`, the adapter reads the band again, revalidates the named
children, and retries once. Another membership conflict returns `CONFLICT`;
an invalid request returns a validation error; denied child access returns
`FORBIDDEN`. Existing whole-band reorder semantics govern concurrent reorders
with unchanged membership; the MCP adapter adds no revision precondition.

## Persistence and observability

No schema migration, priority update, dependency mutation, or session operation
is needed. The existing reorder revision and workspace-scoped `task.reordered`
event describe committed changes; MCP errors describe rejected operations.
