# Primary Session Ownership System Design

## Purpose and boundaries

The task repository stores `task_sessions.is_primary`, and the orchestrator
replaces a primary session that stops or is deleted. This design keeps the
flag single-valued and makes both automatic promotions use the same choice.
[Workflow session lifecycle](workflow-profile-session-lifecycle.md) owns
recipient selection for workflow entries and parking. The message queue keeps
its session-bound targets.

## Requirement mapping

## Components and responsibilities

- `SetSessionPrimary`, `SetSessionPrimaryIfNonterminal`, and the workflow route
  variant in `task/repository/sqlite/session.go` demote every session of the
  task and promote one inside one transaction. They are the only writers that
  can set `is_primary` after creation; the full-row session update only
  releases it.
- `updateTaskSessionWithSnapshotGuard` backs `UpdateTaskSession` and its state
  and revision guarded variants. It writes the session's other columns.
- `bestPrimarySessionCandidate` in `orchestrator/primary_session_candidate.go`
  chooses the session for an automatic promotion.
- `maybePromotePrimary` runs when a session reaches a terminal state, and
  `promoteNextPrimaryAfterRemoval` runs after a session is deleted.

## Data and contracts

No unique index backs `is_primary`, so the promotion transaction is the only
guard. The full-row `UPDATE` also wrote `is_primary` from the caller's copy. A
copy read while a session was primary therefore made it primary again after a
later promotion, without an error, and `GetPrimarySessionByTaskID` could return
either row.

The full-row `UPDATE` never promotes `is_primary`: it keeps the stored flag,
and only a snapshot-guarded write whose session copy says non-primary releases
the owned flag. Promotion and removal still go through `SetSessionPrimary`.
Creation keeps its own `INSERT` (`001.1`). Test fixtures that set the flag
through the full-row write use `SetSessionPrimary`.

`bestPrimarySessionCandidate(ctx, taskID, sessions, excludeSessionID, activeOnly, excludeAwaitingRecovery)`
skips the excluded and terminal sessions and, with `activeOnly`, sessions that
are not active. With `excludeAwaitingRecovery` it also skips a session that
awaits a recovery action. It ranks the rest:

1. A session whose `agent_profile_id` equals the effective profile of the
   task's current step: the step's own profile, a task override, or the
   workflow default. A task without a step, an unreadable step, or no
   resolvable profile treats every session as matching.
2. Any other session.
3. A session with a valid `workflow_parking` marker.
4. A session with an open current-incarnation/generation recovery block or an
   `action_required` dynamic route, last and only for removal promotion.

`sessionAwaitsRecoveryAction` uses the existing `GetOpenSessionRecoveryBlock`.
A read error counts as awaiting recovery; a missing optional store keeps the
existing no-block behavior. No recovery block is resolved by selection.

Inside a rank it keeps the existing order: `RUNNING`, then other active states,
then idle (`001.2`). It returns an empty ID only when no session is eligible,
so a task with only unmatched sessions still gets a primary (`001.3`). A stop
promotion passes `excludeAwaitingRecovery`, so a task whose only remaining
active session awaits recovery keeps its stopped primary. A removal promotion
keeps the last rank, so a task still gets a primary after a deletion.

## Control flow

`maybePromotePrimary` passes `activeOnly=true` and `excludeAwaitingRecovery=true`,
which keeps its rule that only an active session can inherit the role and keeps
a session that awaits recovery off the role. `promoteNextPrimaryAfterRemoval`
passes `false` and `false`; it excludes terminal sessions, which it accepted
before, and keeps a session that awaits recovery as the last-ranked fallback.
Both promote through `SetPrimarySession`, which does not change an explicit
session selection (`001.4`).

`maybePromotePrimary` ignores a FAILED while `resumeAttemptInFlight` reports
a live, unaccepted startup attempt. The lookup reads acceptance under the
registry lock and releases it before promotion storage work. Provider acceptance
transfers startup ownership before the deferred attempt finishes, so accepted,
cancelled and finished attempts do not retain this suppression (`001.2`).

`SetPrimarySession` schedules the terminal-primary queue hand-off (`001.5`)
only when the previous primary is terminal and no resume attempt owns it. The
detached worker checks again that the source is terminal and unowned before it
moves anything, and inside the transfer admission it aborts with
`errTerminalQueueReceiverAwaitsRecovery` when the receiver awaits a recovery
action, so the messages keep their session target.

With `features.terminalPrimaryQueueHandoff` on (`001.5`), `SetPrimarySession`
first reads the current primary. When that session is COMPLETED, FAILED or
CANCELLED, after the promotion write it schedules `handOffTerminalSessionQueue`
to run after the caller returns. Promotion runs inside the stopping session's
queue admission while the transfer locks both sessions in ID order, so running
it inline deadlocks when the receiver's ID sorts first; the scheduled hand-off
uses a context that does not claim the caller's admission. The worker is
derived from the service-owned worker context, so `Stop` cancels it and waits
for it, and no hand-off starts after `Stop`. Hand-offs are serialized and each
resolves the task's current primary when it runs, not when it was scheduled:
if successive promotions fail one primary after another, an earlier hand-off
delivers to the latest primary instead of a session that already handed its
own queue on. It transfers the queue with
`messagequeue.TransferRetiredSessionWithDurableAttachmentPreparation`
(attachments and compensation included), which lifts the retired source's
Auto-run pause inside the transfer's admission on both sessions, so the
repository's combined setting is the receiver's own value at commit, including
a pause the user set while the hand-off waited. Inside that admission the
hand-off also confirms the receiver still holds the primary role, holding the
read side of `primarySwitchMu` until the transfer returns; `SetPrimarySession`
takes the write side only around its repository write. If the role moved
first, the transfer rolls back and the hand-off resolves the primary again (up
to five attempts). It then offers the new primary to
`DrainQueuedMessageIfAutoRun`. A transfer failure logs a warning and leaves
the queue on the terminal session. The flag is read once at startup into the
orchestrator service config.

Accepted, cancelled or finished resume attempts do not retain ownership. Selection does
not resolve unknown-outcome blocks or retry their prompts. The separate opt-in
queue hand-off retains the admission and recovery guards above.

## Failure and recovery

A failed task or step read during selection treats every session as matching,
so a promotion still happens. A failed promotion write logs a warning and
leaves the previous state, as before.

## Persistence

No schema or migration change. Existing rows with two primaries are not
repaired by this change; the next promotion of the task demotes both.

## Security

No permission or trust boundary changes.

## Observability

The existing `auto-promoted primary session` log keeps the old and new IDs.

## Replaced session reclaim

With `features.replacedSessionReclaim` on (`ServiceConfig.ReplacedSessionReclaim`),
only the explicit user promotion (`session.set_primary`, which calls
`PromotePrimarySession`) registers a replaced session. It reads the previous
primary and captures its current `executors_running.agent_execution_id` before
promoting, under a task-scoped lock in `primarySessionReclaimLocks`. After a
successful promotion, it clears any claim on the promoted session and registers
the captured execution in `replacedSessionReclaims` before publishing the
primary update. A later execution cannot become that claim's target. Nothing is stopped inline:
`reclaimReplacedSessionsOnce` evaluates registrations on each idle-reaper tick
(`001.6`).

`SetPrimarySession`, used by automatic promotion, session deletion, and
workflow profile switches, never registers. Those paths only take
the same task-scoped lock around the write and clear the promoted session's
claim, so a later automatic demotion cannot revive an old claim. A stop decision
cannot act on a session they have just promoted. A workflow switch therefore parks or completes
its source with the runtime it expects, and its queue transfer registers
nothing.

A stop runs under the session's prompt admission and a non-blocking lifecycle
lock, and again under the task-scoped promotion lock. It verifies that the
captured registration is still current, so a stale sweep snapshot cannot
revive a removed claim. An unrelated task can promote while this task's
runtime stop is pending. It drops the registration when
the session became primary again, left the task, or its execution rotated or
stopped, and when the claim can never stop the session: it is parked, is in a
terminal state (completed, failed, or cancelled), is an Office task, belongs to
an archived or missing task, or is not eligible for automatic resume. It
defers, keeping the registration, while the session is still starting or
running, while a read fails, or while it has known idle work (an active turn,
language-server lease, background work, open clarification, pending permission,
or pending queued message). Otherwise it calls `StopExecution` for the exact
execution with reason "session replaced". There is no session state write; the
`agent.stopped` handler preserves `WAITING_FOR_INPUT` and `IDLE`, so the
conversation resumes on the next prompt.

With the flag off, `PromotePrimarySession` is `SetPrimarySession`, the tick
returns immediately, and `SetPrimarySession` performs only the promotion.
